        Hi there! You can call me
        <a href="https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Names">jan Jalu</a> (/jan jalu/), jan
        Sante, YAL, or Xander. I'm a computer science and game development
        student at USC, and an aspiring
        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rustacean</a>. Outside of my
        studies, I'm also into recreational mathematics, linguistics (big
        surprise for someone using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">toki pona</a> names
        and Noto Serif, I know), music theory, and speedrunning Legend of Zelda
        games.
      </p>
      <h1 id="projects" class="text-center">pali mi (projects)</h1>
      <p>
        Here are some personal projects and open-source contributions I've made
        through the years. Many of them relate to <i>Skyward Sword</i>, my
        favorite game in the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> series.
      </p>

            >ssgz (Skyward Sword practice ROM)</a
          ></strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p>
        ssgz is my most recent Skyward Sword-related project. Inspired by
        <a href="https://github.com/zsrtww/tww-gz">twwgz</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/zsrtp/tpgz">tpgz</a>, it is a practice ROM
        hack for speedrunners and researchers. Users can open a custom menu
        in-game to access practice tools. Key features include...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Useful cheats (such as infinite
          <span style="color: #ffabab">health</span>, infinite
          <span style="color: #22aa22">stamina</span>, infinite ammo, and moon
          jump)
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to save & load position and entrance information to
          quickly reload an area
        </li>
        <li>
          A practice saves menu (allowing users to quickly practice a specific
          part of a speedrun route without having to load saves externally)
        </li>
        <li>
          A menu containing certain tricks and boss fights from various speedrun
          categories, that, when enabled, will load the user into the scenario
          the trick takes place in, reloading if the trick is performed
          successfully or when the user requests a reload.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Working on gz has helped me greatly with learning Rust. Similar to the
        <a href="#rando">randomizer</a>, much of the game's patches are written
        in Rust (compiled to PowerPC assembly with build scripts) or raw
        assembly. I decided to write the patcher (the command-line or GUI
        utility that patches the game) in Rust, partially for learning purposes,
        and partially to speed up the process of extracting, patching, and
        repacking the game.

          >Skyward Sword Randomizer</a
        >
      </h2>
      <p>
        The randomizer for <i>Skyward Sword</i> first released in October of
        2020. I got introduced to it in the following January and was promptly
        hooked. At the time, I was still in high school, and I had taken an
        interest in programming. Come September, I decided to try my hand at
        open-source contribution for the first time and submitted my first pull
        request for a small feature addition. With the guidance of other
        developers, I got more comfortable with the codebase and working on more
        complex features. Among my favorite tasks were...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adding
          <a href="https://github.com/ssrando/ssrando/pull/214">Triforces</a> as
          shuffleable items
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding the ability to
          <a href="https://github.com/ssrando/ssrando/pull/257">dowse</a> for
          useful items in treasure chests
          <ul>
            <li>
              This was my first foray into assembly patching, as some low-level
              game patches were necessary to get chests to act as dowsing
              targets
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ssrando/ssrando/pull/597"
            >Hint Importance</a
          >: specifying if useful items that appear in hints are
          <span style="color: #2a2">required</span> (the seed cannot be
          completed without it),
          <span style="color: #aaa">not required</span> (the item doesn't unlock
          any locations with useful items), or
          <span style="color: #dc8">possibly required</span> (the location
          leads to useful items, but the seed can still be completed without
          it).
          <ul>
            <li>
              This was an interesting problem to solve, and leveraging a logic
              flattening algorithm (thanks to robojumper, maintainer of the SS
              Randomizer Tracker) made hint importance calculations faster
              <i>and</i> more accurate
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      </h3>
      <p>
        In early 2025, fellow randomizer contributor Battlecats59 started work
        on an implementation of Skyward Sword Randomizer for
        <a href="https://archipelago.gg/">Archipelago</a>, a platform for
        cross-game randomizers. I offered to help shortly after, and have been
        working with him towards getting the game officially merged in.
        Recently, thanks to some earlier Wii networking experiments by lead
        randomizer developer lepelog, I added console support to SSR
        Archipelago. The modified game code opens a UDP server on the Wii,
        allowing the player to connect their console to their multiworld client.
        This is the first Wii game to have support for multiworld randomization
        on official hardware!
